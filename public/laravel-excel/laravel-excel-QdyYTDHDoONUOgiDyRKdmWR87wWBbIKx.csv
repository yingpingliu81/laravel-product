701453,How to Watch TV ,"<p>
<span class=""dropcap"">T</span>he SatKing Pro Max is an automatic satellite TV system
required to receive the satellite TV signal but to watch TV you
need to connect a set top box.
There are two options when to comes to set top boxes, you
can either buy a VAST receiver or bring your own Foxtel
satellite
set top box. Using either is simple, just plug your
receiver or set top box into the Pro Max and you will be
watching TV in a minute or so.</p>
<h2>VAST TV Explained</h2>
<p>
<span class=""dropcap"">V</span>AST is the most popular method of watching TV with your
Automatic satellite TV system. VAST is basically the same
channels as you receive in the capital city but with commercials
from regional Australia. You receive ABC, SBS, 7, 9, 10 and their
secondary channels like ABC2, GO, Gem,
One, Eleven,
7Two
and 7Mate. VAST receivers are available from all Pro Max
dealers. With VAST there are no subscription charges.</p>
<h2>Foxtel Explained</h2>
<p>
<span class=""dropcap"">I</span>f you choose to bring your own Foxtel
satellite
set top
box, just simply plug the set top box into the Pro Max
and within a minute or so all the channels you access at
home will be available. Note catch up TV services are
delivered by the internet and can't be received via
satellite TV and subscription charge apply.</p>",1498531,23-Feb-2017 02:50:08 PM,23-Feb-2017 10:12:12 AM,23-Feb-2017 02:50:09 PM,23-Feb-2017 02:50:09 PM,,N,how-to-watch-tv,How to Watch TV ,,/images/blog/Satking-PRO-MAX-Set.jpg,how-to-watch-tv,/satking-promax-blog/how-to-watch-tv
701549,How to Install,"<p>
<span class=""dropcap"">T</span>he SatKing Pro Max requires only a very small amount of space to be installed, in general half the area of a convential old style round dish. </p>
<div class=""col-md-6"" style=""line-height: 1.8em;"">
<p>No longer do you
have to position your motorised system in the rear corner of the van and have long cable runs. The unit can be installed where it is convenient or even directly
above your TV making installation even easier. The diargams below shows the area required for the Pro Max to operate, in general the Pro Max needs clearance
of 50cm from the centre of the unit but as per below some existing products on your roof can be within the 50cm exclusion area depending on their height.</p>
<p>
With the Pro Max you can either do a self install or get your caravan dealer to install the unit for you. SatKing or dealers can also recommend installers in your
local area to do the complete installation for you.
